## Contributing to Kalendae

1. Please submit all pull requests to the `dev` branch from your own named branch (not your master).
2. Please only include the changes within the `src/` directory, do not include new builds.
3. New code should match the existing code style, with hard tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment, and [BSD/KNF style bracketing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#BSD_KNF_style).
4. Please be aware that I have family and work obligations and may take some time to respond to your Pull Request.
